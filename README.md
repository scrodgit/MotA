## What is MotA?
Maestro of the Avatar (MotA) is a MIDI-to-ABC converter for Shroud of the Avatar: Forsaken Virtues. It's been modded/converted from Maestro; a well known open-source ABC Converter for Lord of the Rings
Online (LOTRO) to support SotA's musical scale and instrumentation.


## Why would you make MotA?
I quickly found out that my vaulted files were either broken or obsolete when played in SotA's ABC framework. While some files were "ok", they weren't using the frameworks full capability. When I looked
into ABC programs for SotA, there really was none. It seemed like I had a choice between buying another game to use it's 3rd party composer, or use free tools that were geared for other specific games. Maestro felt the best to me out of all of them, but it still wasn't right. So, we went to work. After learning more about the specifics of SotA's framework, I, with the help of scroda and other notable musicians in the community; began making edits to Maestro's code to reflect those specifics. First came SotA's piano, and shortly after the drums. Piece by piece, the other instruments and refinements were layered in, while misc. LOTRO components were phased out. With that, "MotA" was born.


## How much does it cost?
MotA is free to use, and open-source like it's parent. While free, donations of in-game currency (Gold/CotO) are welcome. There are no benefits to donating other than the display of gratitude being humbly reciprocated :)


## Will MotA be updated?
I will update MotA for as long as I play. The code will always be open-source, so anyone with the aptitude could simply succeed me and make it their own.
